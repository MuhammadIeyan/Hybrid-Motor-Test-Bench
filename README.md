# Hybrid-Motor-Test-Bench
As a class project, we were tasked to rebuild the Toyota Prius Hybrid Motor as a Test Bench.
As a continuous project, each year every student would try to improve the project to make it functional.
The Test bench is composed of an asynchronous motor, a brush-less motor, a flywheel simulating the mass of the car, 
electromagnetic brake, an Arduino a motor drive and some sensors.

Personnaly, we managed to control the motor to achieve maximum velocity through Arduino PWM modulation, an OP AMP.

In the documentation, you will find the code for controlling the motor at its max velocity as well as the report.
